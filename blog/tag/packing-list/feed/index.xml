<p>What even are people wearing to Norway? I remember checking the weather for my trip in May to find sub-freezing lows, but highs of 65℉ (18.3℃.) One thing is for sure, Norway has got range. This large difference in temperatures opens the door for a lot of questions. What should I wear hiking? Will it be warm enough to swim? How much should I pack to keep warm? I have learned that poor planning can really ruin a trip, and with that in mind, I felt I should make a blog post dedicated to what to pack for your Norway trip! After tons of research, and then personally testing out items, I found a few things I was so grateful to have, and some things that never made it out of the suitcase. There is even a lil packing checklist I made just for you at the bottom of the page. Let&#8217;s dive into exactly what to pack for your Norway Trip!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Suit Up</h3>



<p>Preparing for the elements might vary from breezy T-shirts to<a href="https://www.patagonia.com/product/womens-cord-fjord-down-coat/26881.html?dwvar_26881_color=PNGR"> puffy jackets</a> &#8211; all within the same day. The best decision? Layering. I know it is cliché, but taking off layers when you are hot or insulating when you are cold can make a tough hike significantly more comfortable, especially when you get hot during the uphill, but cold at the top. Here is what to look into so you can have the best experience</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>My number 1 favorite thing &#8211; seriously, I cannot give it enough hype &#8211; <a href="https://amzn.to/4czlQTl">Merino Wool Baselayers</a></strong></h4>



<p>Did anyone else have the experience as a child of getting thermal underwear and it being itchy, uncomfortable, and WAY too hot? Imagine all of those problems floating away <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f60c.png" alt="😌" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f54a.png" alt="🕊" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> If that sounds good to you, you will LOVE Merino wool base layers. They breathe, wick sweat, don’t smell, keep you at a perfect temperature, and are so freaking comfortable. I am convinced that it is because of magic that these work so well. If there is any article of clothing whose praises I will sing from the mountain tops, it is these.</p>



<p>The only downside is that they can be a little pricey, but they do go on sale quite often. I bought the top and bottoms at the end of winter for between $60-$70 each. If you aren’t in a rush, wait for a good sale! <a href="https://amzn.to/3Z0UD8K">Here is another well-reviewed pair</a> that is a little less expensive if you want options. Not to be dramatic, but they might just change your life &#8211; or at least change the way you hike in cold weather. This is for sure one item you should pack for your Norway trip.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Mid-Layers</strong></h4>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignleft size-medium is-resized"><img decoding="async" width="240" height="300" src="/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Packing-list-2-240x300.jpg" alt="Michelle in heavy duty winter gear in Svalbard" class="wp-image-155" style="width:359px;height:auto" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Packing-list-2-240x300.jpg 240w, /wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Packing-list-2-819x1024.jpg 819w, /wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Packing-list-2-768x960.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Packing-list-2.jpg 960w" sizes="(max-width: 240px) 100vw, 240px" /></figure></div>


<p>For your mid layers, you will want something with minimal bulk so wearing an outer layer will still be comfortable and non-constricting. I used some of my long-sleeved tops from home, as well as some <a href="https://www.patagonia.com/product/womens-r1-fleece-pullover/40119.html?dwvar_40119_color=BLK&amp;cgid=womens-fleece-pullovers">lightweight pullovers</a>. You can also get a <a href="https://amzn.to/4dCGRxJ">fleece vest</a> if you are going further north where temperatures are extra cold. One thing to remember here is where you can layer up. For the coldest days, I had my base layer, a pair of jeans, and a pair of <a href="https://www.patagonia.com/product/womens-quandary-hiking-pants-regular/55417.html?dwvar_55417_color=FGE&amp;cgid=womens-pants-jeans">looser hiking pants</a> over the top of those. Adding in a pair of gloves and a hat (both of which I forgot and bought in Norway) is a lifesaver. The other amazing thing I was so grateful I had was a nice, warm scarf. Especially in the Svalbard portion of my trip, the chill wind was especially hard on my nose and cheeks. It was so helpful to have a scarf that I could loop around and cover my face. I seriously considered bringing a <a href="https://amzn.to/46UgYXK">balaclava,</a>  but I ended up leaving it at home. I would 100% recommend one if you venture far north and earlier in the year than I did. A <a href="https://amzn.to/4duVmDS">thick pair of wo</a><a href="https://www.rei.com/product/165398/rei-co-op-merino-wool-lightweight-hiking-crew-socks">ol socks </a>paired with my hiking boots were incredibly nice to have as well.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Outer layers</strong></h4>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img decoding="async" width="683" height="1024" src="/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Packing-list-1-2-683x1024.jpg" alt="Cameron in a heavy winter coat" class="wp-image-160" style="width:359px;height:auto" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Packing-list-1-2-683x1024.jpg 683w, /wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Packing-list-1-2-200x300.jpg 200w, /wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Packing-list-1-2-768x1152.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Packing-list-1-2.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px" /></figure></div>


<p>A few things to consider when choosing an outer coat are warmth potential and wind &amp; rainproofing abilities. Let&#8217;s talk about both of these <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f447-1f3fb.png" alt="👇🏻" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Warmth Potential</strong></h5>



<p>When I started researching, everywhere I looked talked about how Down is the very best insulator out there. It tends to be:<br>1.) More breathable than synthetic-filled jackets, which is a huge plus for hiking.<br>2.) Lightweight, less bulky, and more compressible which is important when you have to prioritize every inch of space in your travel bags<br>3.) Fairly Durable. While water can compress the fluffiness (known as loft,) down jackets are, overall, pretty long-lasting and considered a good investment.</p>



<p>Now, if you spend any time looking at down jackets, you will come across the term “Fill Power” with an associated number. Usually, the number is between 500 and 800 and is simply a unit of measure for the quality of down used which directly impacts how warm the jacket will be. Generally* the lower the number, the less insulating; the higher, the more insulating. For context, I used a down jacket with 600 Fill Power and it did the trick for me, especially when paired with underlayers.</p>



<p>*<em>Some coats can weigh more with a lower-rated fill power and are still warm simply because the coat is stuffed with more down. Be sure to compare the coat&#8217;s weight and the fill power if you are particular about your insulation</em>.</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Wind &amp; Rain Proofing</strong></h5>



<p>The other thing to know about down jackets is that the feathers do not do well if they get wet. They will pack down, cling together, and fail to insulate you effectively. If you plan on being in a wet climate, be sure to use a <a href="https://amzn.to/3ArHiw3">waterproof outer layer</a> or pop a <a href="https://amzn.to/3WViLak">raincoat</a> on over your down jacket. I cannot emphasize enough the power of a good rain jacket. Seriously, it rains a lot in Norway and it was a lifesaver for me to quickly put one on while it was pouring. If you are layering a raincoat over your heavy jacket, you may want to go up a size when you purchase.</p>



<p>The time of year I visited was May, and I did not pack an intense outer layer for my legs such as snowboarding pants or a snowsuit. This was partially because I didn’t have enough space, and I only own a lightweight pair. With my base layer, long socks, jeans, and hiking pants over the top, I didn’t ever get miserably cold. In places like Svalbard, certain tours supply you with warm-weather gear. If you want to book a tour, keep an eye out for this detail.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>I didn&#8217;t even think about that!</strong></h3>



<p>When you choose what to pack for your Norway trip, some things are obvious &#8211; socks, underwear, etc &#8211; so I won&#8217;t waste your time reminding you to bring them. However, some things make a huge difference in your trip that might take you by surprise. Here are a few of mine:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/3Xcwnzb">Dark Eye Mask</a>. If you go to Norway during the summer, you will experience extended hours of daylight and Midnight Sun. Having an eye mask can make a huge difference in your quality of sleep!</li>



<li>Swimsuit. In the land of snow and mountains? Yes! The number of beautiful lakes and fjords available to swim in is substantial. The water will probably be cold, but it is absolutely refreshing. Additionally, a sauna is a true Scandinavian experience, but some may require a swimsuit.</li>



<li><a href="https://amzn.to/4dTvmSo">Sunglasses</a>. Trust me on this one, especially if you plan on hiking in snow. On a bright day, the snow was so reflective that I found myself squinting. One of our tour guides mentioned that she gets headaches if she doesn&#8217;t wear sunglasses and is out hiking all day. I didn&#8217;t have to test this one out thankfully.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What to skip</strong></h3>



<p><em>Hey Michelle, what about the fancy stuff? </em>I am so glad you asked! From time to time, I have packed a really elegant outfit for photos at the top of a mountain. I can safely say that this didn&#8217;t happen during this trip. I think this is partially because getting to the top of a mountain in Norway requires Maximum Effort<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> and I wanted to keep my hiking backpack as dialed in as possible. While I love the idea of a photo like that, it wasn&#8217;t one of my goals for this trip (though I do admire anyone who accomplishes this feat.) In this same line of thought, there weren&#8217;t many places that had an upscale dress code. Much of the activities in Norway &#8211; at least, the ones that drew me in &#8211; are outdoorsy. If I had to choose between packing a pretty dress or making sure I had space for a puffer coat, I would choose the coat. That isn&#8217;t to say you can&#8217;t pack something nice! If you plan your trip well, and around the activities you enjoy, you should be able to pack whatever outfits support that desire.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Final Thoughts</h2>



<p>Choosing what to pack for your Norway trip shouldn&#8217;t be a stressful thing. Keep the goal of staying warm, dry, and comfortable at the forefront of your mind and you will be totally fine! Whether you are walking the colorful streets of Bergen, or hiking the peaks of Svalbard, the right attire can enhance your experience. Especially in Norway, the experience is everything!
